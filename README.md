Lectures
========

University courses and other presentations, mostly covering Web Architecture, REST, SOA, XML (XSLT/XSD), and similar stuff.

License

These are sources for professional presentations that I make available for others to read/use/reuse; please respect [the licensing](LICENSE).

Online
------

Online versions of the actual presentations can be found at http://dret.net/lectures/ (or a handy overview table at http://dret.net/netdret/publications#presentations), but older presentations you see there are not part of the github repo (I might change that if I find the time to move them from their older svn home to the new github repo).
